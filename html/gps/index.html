    <!-- The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to help define what content you are adding into your page (section, header, footer, etc.) I think they are all incredibly useful... things like header and footer give you an idea of where the page begins and ends, while main shows you the main content of the page. 

    The browser will display the elements on the page in the order you have them within your html file. 

    In this challenge, I learned how to create snippets and why they are useful. I would definitely consider creating more snippets, as they are a great time-saver.

    During this challenge I was mostly thrown off by the differences between things like sections, articles, asides, etc. But I guess the difference is more in what you the developer are using each of these elements for and creating a distinction for you or for others reading your HTML. -->
