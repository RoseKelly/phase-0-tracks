# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Answer: Version control allows you to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and merge revisions made by different people. It's useful for tracking changes that have been made to a code base overtime and debugging when issues arise.


* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Answer: Branches are essentially "copies" of your project or file. Branches are useful for making any changes or updates to your project, because the master branch should only have your finalized code.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Answer: A commit creates a "save point" in Git. Commit messages should say exactly what was changed/added/updated to the file. For example: "Add file1.md and file2.md to main folder"


* What is a merge conflict?
Answer: Merge conflicts can happen when the changes you've made to one branch disagrees with the another. Git will let you know when there has been a conflict merging branches.
